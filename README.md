Introduction
In 2019, 47 million children under the age of 5 were affected by acute undernutrition, provoked by limited intake of nutrients. Even in well developed countries, children and adults alike are exposed to food of low quality and that provides no real nutritional value. 
Our work is a first step in the creation of a comprehensive ontology that has a list of commonly made recipes (that could include either homemade foods as well as commercially available products) and that allows determining whether a recipe is healthy or not by reasoning on the amount of proteins, vitamins, calcium and more, that each recipe contains.
With a more detailed dataset, the query that we wrote over the ontology allows in an easy step to determine whether a recipe is healthy or not.
